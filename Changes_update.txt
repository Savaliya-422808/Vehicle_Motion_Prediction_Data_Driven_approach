Readme

We have implemented the LSTM model for the motion prediction algorithm. The results for the minimum error achieved on id 27 on 14.08.2022 is saved in the respective NN_velocity excel file. 
A separate folder is created for the LSTM model with the name code_LSTM_Model.

The results are as follows: 

The average displacement error is 1.568 m
The average final displacement error is 1.713 m
The average absolute heading error is 6.48 degrees

The other result obtained on the same id on 15.08.2022 is saved as well in the same folder. The result is as follows:

The average displacement error is 2.254 m
The average final displacement error is 2.043 m
The average absolute heading error is 21.4 degrees

The excel for the respective results will be found in this folder. 



We have implemented the FCN Keras model as well by changing the Hyperparameters such as number of layers, number of neurons, and learning rate.
A separate folder is created for the FCN Keras model with name code_FCN_Keras.



We compared the results of FCN as well as the LSTM model in our report and presentation.



Thank you.
